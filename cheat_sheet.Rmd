## Introduction

This is a very brief list of the most used git commands with short explanations and simple examples.

## Getting started

After installing Git, it is good to customize your Git environment. The command to do it is:
```git
    git config
```

### Your identity

The first thing you should do is to set your user name and email address. This is used by Git in every commit:

```git
    git config --global user.name "Dobrin Petkov"
    git config --global user.email "dobrinpetkov@gmail.com"
```

### Your editor

Next you may want to set up your text editor. It is used whenever Git needs you to type in a message. If not set up, the default editor will be used:


```git
    git config --global core.editor emacs
```

### Your Settings

To check your settings just type:

```git
    git config --list
```

### Getting Help

From the shell:
```git 
    git help <verb>
    git <verb> help
    man git-<verb>
```

For example, if you want help on config:

```git 
    git help config
    git config help
    man git-config
```
